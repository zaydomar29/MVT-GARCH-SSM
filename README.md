All files are written for R. All functions are written in RCPP.

The files offer a quick guide to getting the 4D-CCC-GARCH(1,1) up and running. Currently (May 2024)
the functions are designed to run the 4D model. Simple modifications to the code will allow users
to run models in any dimension. Currently, the goal is to write an R-package that will run the 
functions for any dimension.

This manuscript has been accepted to Statistics in Medicine for publication.
