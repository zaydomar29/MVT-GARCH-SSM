All files are written for R. All functions are written in RCPP.

The files offer a quick guide to getting the multivariate-CCC-GARCH(1,1) up and running. The R-scripts are written to run generate the 4D-model as presented in the manuscript. Simple modifications to the code will allow users
to run models in any dimension. Currently, the goal is to write an R-package that will run the 
functions for any dimension.

This manuscript has been accepted to Statistics in Medicine for publication.
