# MVT-GARCH-SSM
Repository for all the code, simulations for the GARCH-model and the multivariate standard state-space model.

All files are written for R. All functions are written in RCPP.

The files offer a quick guide to getting the multivariate-CCC-GARCH(1,1) up and running. The R-scripts are written to generate the 4D model as presented in the manuscript. Simple modifications to the code will allow users to run models in any dimension.

Step-by-step guides for the implementation are also provided.
