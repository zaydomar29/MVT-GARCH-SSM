This folder contains the R code needed to generate, estimate and evaluate the multivariate CCC-Garch(1,1) model and the standard SSM.

See the **/GARCH/** folder for an implementation of the GARCH model and the **/Standard-MVT-SSM/** folder for an implementation of the standard SSM model.
Both folders contain a step-by-step guide for their model implementations.
